## The Protocol: Data Structures

Regarding my original BG, I will be looking at what's the detailed, optimized data structure of ETH, e.g., what's in each trie that got hashed into the Merkle root within each block. Further, how different kinds of databases can be built.  

### 04/05 MPT

[Reference](https://epf.wiki/#/wiki/protocol/data-structures?id=data-structures-in-ethereum)



(Delving into the data structures of eth for a better understanding of building relational databases for eth transactions.)

1. Merkle Patricia Trie as the primary data structure for storing the execution layer state. PT: all data is stored in the leaf nodes. Space efficient.

	3 types of nodes in ETH MPT:
	
	- Branch Nodes: 1 node value + 16 branches = 17-element array. 
	- Extension Nodes: optimized, compressed, eliminating redundant branch nodes with single children.
	- Leaf Nodes: key-value pairs. Value = node content; Key = node hash.

![MPT](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/ETH-MPT.jpg)
(The root is also an extension node)

2. Within one ETH block, 4 different modified MPTs:

 	- **Transaction Trie:** Nonce, from, to, value, etc.
	- **Receipt Trie:** logs, status code, etc.
	- **World State Trie:** nonce, balance, storageRoot, etc.
	- **Account State(Storage) Trie:** storageRoot

([Visualization](https://epf.wiki/#/wiki/protocol/data-structures))

Insight: 1. Efficient data retrieval in MPT. 2. translating MPT into relational schemas, different parts of the Merkle tree can be stored in different tables. For building/saving historical data as relational databases using schemas with certain normalization levels, tables can be stored separately--nodes table, accounts state table, transactions table, etc. 

3. TODO: On Merkle Trees in ETH and ZKP: how ZKP project tables could be generated?

### 04/06 MPT

1. More MPT: ETH vs ZKP

	Iden3 as an example:

	Store & validate claims:
	
	![zkp-mt1](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/ZKP3.png)

	![zkp-mt2](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/ZKP4.png)

	Able to design such a circuit which recreates the calculation model of the root of a merkle tree to verify the received proofs by recalculating the root of the merkle tree.

	[zkp in identity systems](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/Zero-knowledge-Proofs.md)
	
   
2. Verkle Update: A better MPT, optimized by reducing witness size.

 - "The main difference between the Verkle tree and the Merkle tree structure is that the Verkle tree is much flatter, meaning there are fewer intermediate nodes linking a leaf to the root, and therefore less data required to generate a proof."

More on the three important components: gas, memory, storage

[A more detailed illustration of EVM](https://takenobu-hs.github.io/downloads/ethereum_evm_illustrated.pdf)

1. Gas
From the more detailed but clear illustration:
![gas1](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/Screenshot%202024-04-10%20004707.png)
![gas2](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/Screenshot%202024-04-10%20004725.png)

3. Memory: read and write using the SLOAD and SSTORE opcode.

   		Memory expansion
 		In EVM, memory is dynamically allocated in multiples of 1 word “pages”. Gas is charged for the number of pages expanded. All locations in memory are well-defined initially as zero.
   
4. Storage: also use SLOAD and SSTORE. Storage is designed as a word-addressed word array. Unlike memory, storage is associated with an Ethereum account and is persisted across transactions as part of the world state.

## Consensus Layer

### 04/10

The p2p network, and 7594, and its relationship with 4844.

The consensus clients participate in a separate peer-to-peer network with a different specification. Consensus clients need to participate in block gossip so that they can receive new blocks from peers and broadcast them when it is their turn to be block proposers. Similar to the execution layer, this first requires a discovery protocol so that a node can find peers and establish secure sessions for exchanging blocks, attestations, etc.

1. EIP-4844
   	Blobs of course. For scalability, support L2 rollups.
    	[danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/)
2. EIP-7594 - Peer Data Availability Sampling
	Extend the capabilities introduced by 4844.

	"The intent of a PeerDAS design is to reuse well-known, battle-tested p2p components already in production in Ethereum to bring additional DA scale beyond that of 4844 while keeping the minimum amount of work of honest nodes in the same realm as 4844 (downloading < 1MB per slot)."

Impossible triangle of scaling - trilemma

![trilemma](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/blockchain-trilemma.png)

### 04/13

More on scalability [core changes](https://epf.wiki/?#/wiki/research/scaling/core-changes/core-changes):

The ultimate goals of Ethereum scalability:

 - Transition the execution layer (dApps) entirely to L2 rollups.
   
 - Optimize Ethereum, the L1, to serve primarily as the settlement and data availability layer.

The Consensus Layer (CL) is key for rollups in terms of Data Availability (DA) and for storing proofs of validity, particularly for ZK rollups, as it aims to achieve scalability and reduce Ethereum's gas costs. 

Outline of the development phases for the CL:

1. Proto-danksharding (EIP-4844): This initial phase introduced "blobs" to the network, which are large data batches that help improve scalability by providing a cost-effective way to store large amounts of data necessary for rollups. It was implemented on March 14, 2024.

2. Increasing blob count & gas modifications: Scheduled for the end of 2024, this phase aims to increase the number of blobs that can be included in each block and adjust gas pricing to optimize network throughput and costs.

3. Addition of PeerDAS: This phase involves incorporating a decentralized autonomous system (PeerDAS) for further enhancement of data availability solutions, making the network more robust and scalable.

4. Full implementation of Danksharding: The final phase completes the roadmap by fully implementing Danksharding, which is expected to dramatically increase network capacity and reduce costs by optimizing data shard handling.


### 04/14

Complete walk-through of 4844:

Overview: EIP-4844 introduces "blob-carrying transactions" to scale Ethereum's data availability in a cost-effective manner without fully implementing sharding (still "proto"). It would enable the storage of large data blobs on the beacon chain, further increasing rollup scalability compared to the base chain, by at least two orders of magnitude. 4844 outlines blob transaction parameters, gas accounting, **new opcodes**, and **execution layer changes** to cope with these transactions. This EIP would allow for the shifting to a full sharding paradigm while enabling all the current needs of rollups.

### 04/15 & 04/16 Days Off 

### 04/17 

Learn 4844 thoroughly [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)

Before 4844 was live on mainnet, rollups have been storing data only via a section of the transaction known as calldata. 4844  introduces "Blobs" to replace calldata, which modifies the current transaction and block structure. 

Aim to: scalability up, cost down. In detail:

1. **Objective:** To temporarily boost Ethereum's scalability by introducing new transaction types that include large data blobs.

2. **Implementation:** Adds blob-carrying transactions, which enable storing large amounts of data intended primarily for use by rollups.

3. **Technical Additions:** New Transactions Types: Specific types that can carry and reference data blobs.

4. **Cryptographic Enhancements:** Methods for secure and efficient handling of large data blobs.

5. **Impact:** Requires modifications at the consensus level to support the new data structures and transaction types.

6. **Scalability Benefits:** Designed to reduce transaction costs for rollups, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency.

7. **Strategic Goals:** Sets foundational changes for Ethereum's transition towards a fully sharded architecture in the future.

### 04/18
Other EIPs regarding data availability.

EIP-7624:
1. Objective: Increase the gas cost for calldata to reduce the maximum Ethereum block size.
2. Rationale: Mitigates block size variance and supports the incorporation of data availability blobs as per EIP-4844.
3. New Gas Pricing: Introduces adjustments in gas costs, affecting transactions that use Ethereum mainly for data storage.
4. Block Size Target: Aims to limit the maximum block size to approximately 0.6 MB.
5. Impact on Transactions: Primarily affects data storage transactions; minimal impact on transactions with substantial EVM computation.
6. Implementation: Requires a network upgrade to implement the changes.
7. Overall Goal: Enhance network efficiency and stability without significantly affecting the majority of users.

### 04/19

[About Gas Limit](https://ethresear.ch/t/on-increasing-the-block-gas-limit/18567)
1. By increasing the block gas limit and the price for nonzero calldata bytes, a smaller and less variable block size can be achieved, making space to add more blobs in the future.
2. Increasing the price for nonzero calldata reduces the maximum possible block size. At the same time, the block gas limit could be raised to make more space for regular transactions.
3. This further incentivizes the transition to using blobs for data availability, strengthening the multidimensional fee market by reducing competition between calldata and blobs.
4. It slows down history growth, which might be preferable in preparing for the Verkle upgrades.

### 04/20
[EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488): Transaction calldata gas cost reduction with total calldata limit. 

Looking at how scalability solutions evolved these years. It was back in 2021, further cut costs for rollups, and to incentivize an ecosystem-wide transition to a rollup-centric Ethereum. 

parameters added:

| Parameter    | Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| NEW_CALLDATA_GAS_COST  | 3    |
| FebrBASE_MAX_CALLDATA_PER_BLOCKuary | 1,048,576     |
| CALLDATA_PER_TX_STIPEND    | 300    |

Summary: it decreases transaction calldata gas cost, and add a limit of how much total transaction calldata can be in a block.

Also, talked about the rationale:

A natural alternative proposal is to decrease NEW_CALLDATA_GAS_COST without adding a limit. However, this presents a security concern: **today(2021), the average block size is 60-90 kB, but the maximum block size is 30M / 16 = 1,875,000 bytes (plus about a kilobyte of block and tx overhead)**. Simply decreasing the calldata gas cost from 16 to 3 would increase the maximum block size to 10M bytes. This would push the Ethereum p2p networking layer to unprecedented levels of strain and risk breaking the network; some previous live tests of ~500 kB blocks a few years ago had already taken down a few bootstrap nodes.

The decrease-cost-and-cap proposal achieves most of the benefits of the decrease, as rollups are unlikely to dominate Ethereum block space in the short term future and so 1.5 MB will be sufficient, while preventing most of the security risk.

**The bold part gives a sense of the data sizes**

### 04/22 

Another angle: looking at deneb

Deneb is a consensus-layer upgrade containing a number of features. Including:

1. EIP-4788: Beacon block root in the EVM
2. EIP-4844: Shard Blob Transactions scale data-availability of Ethereum in a simple, forwards-compatible manner
3. EIP-7044: Perpetually Valid Signed Voluntary Exits
4. EIP-7045: Increase Max Attestation Inclusion Slot
5. EIP-7514: Add Max Epoch Churn Limit

One dumb question: why are the consensus-specs written in python?

## MEV 

### 04/23

**Proposer Builder Separation (PBS)** is important b/c 
	1. It creates opportunities to prevent transaction censorship at the protocol level. 
 	2. It prevents hobbyist validators from being out-competed by institutional players that can better optimize the profitability of their block building. 
  	3. It helps with scaling Ethereum by enabling the Danksharding upgrades.

The Role of the Builder: Gather and validate transactions into a block body, also order them for a better block space and gas usage.

The Role of the Proposer: validate and take block bodies from builders, and complete the block by adding metadata such as block header. 

- Also, PBS also reflects an overall goal of The Merge to move Ethereum’s network towards a more modular future. Specifically, the transition to PoS is an aggressive move towards decentralization through modularity.

- "When you break apart the different pieces of block construction, you can decentralize them individually. This allows different actors with different specialties to focus on their particular strengths. The net result is a more capable network with fewer external dependencies and a lower threshold for participation."

### 04/24

**MEV and PBS**

MEV is the arbitrage from transaction ordering. **PBS solves this problem by reconfiguring the economics of MEV.** Instead of the block proposer doing their own MEV searching, they simply pick a block from many offered to them by block builders. The block builders might have done sophisticated MEV extraction, but the reward for it goes to the block proposer. 

To sum up, the separation makes it very hard for builders to order transactions in an arbitrage way.

Block building and centralization: 

The important concept is "prover-verifier asymmetry" which refers to the idea that centralized block production is fine as long as there is a robust and maximally decentralized network of validators able to prove the blocks are honest.

**Mev-boost: A popular PBS Implementation**

(Flashbots is doing good on mev-boost)

How it works:
![mev-boost](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/mev-boost.png)

to sum up, replaying on external block building, searchers' negative arbitrage impact are excluded. 

### 04/27

More interpretable detail implementations of Mev-Boost by Flashbots today.

"PoS node operators must run three pieces of software: a validator client, a consensus client, and an execution client. MEV-boost is a sidecar for the beacon node - a separate piece of open source software, which queries and outsources block-building to a network of builders."

Q: Why need mev-boost as a proposer? What incentive?
A: To earn a fair share of the MEV extracted in the blocks you propose.

Q: Who runs an external relay? And what exactly is a relay?
A: Relays **aggregate blocks from multiple builders** in order to select the block with the highest fees. A relay has the power to censor or frontrun any block proposed by a block builder.
![mev-boost-relays](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/mev-boost-relays.png) 
Flashbots network running it with their policy of neutrality and transparency.

Q: How will Flashbots make sure that the relay treats their builder fairly compared to other builders?
A: "Our relay will publish the logs of when blocks were received by builders and when they were supplied to proposers."

Flashbots also has many other implementations and solutions regarding MEV.

Now that I had some basic understanding of scalability by looking at those EIPs and Vitalik's posts. Now from an applicational angle of scaling, I'll briefly (or intensely) and quickly learn about topics that can benefit scalability.

## ZKP first

### 04/28 
General purpose ZKP:
![zkp-general](https://github.com/WildcatsC/eth-projects/blob/main/assets-pics/zkp-general.png)

ZK-SNARK: The main idea of zk-SNARKs is that they are all about proving that you know some polynomial f(x) that has some roots. The hard part is translating a program into a polynomial.

Rollups in general.

[Jon Charbonneau](https://twitter.com/jon_charb?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor): [Rollups Aren't Real?](https://joncharbonneau.substack.com/p/rollups-arent-real)

Sum:

Talked about decentralization and trust issues associated with different types of rollups like ZK rollups and optimistic rollups. 

1.Rollup solutions are often not fully decentralized or trustless. Many rely on trusted, permissioned setups which can potentially centralize control and reduce censorship resistance.
2. Technical mechanisms like forced transaction inclusion, where even if a rollup operator is censoring users, they should be able to force their transactions onto the rollup to preserve censorship resistance.
3. Sequencers and Consensus: The role of sequencers in rollups is examined, including how they batch transactions and their implications for decentralization. The article also discusses different models of leader selection and consensus mechanisms within rollups.
5. The challenges of managing cross-chain atomicity (transactions across multiple blockchains) and MEV.
6. For future directions and improvements, proposed more **sophisticated sequencer selection mechanisms** and better handling of transaction batching and MEV.


### 05/01

So, with that in mind (much to be done for rollups and scalability), put those fancy rollups aside, look closer AGAIN at:

- Ethereum scalability
- History of sharding and path forward
- Data availability

Data Availability Sampling DAS

DAS is in some ways a mirror image of randomly sampled committees.

Weakness of ONLY using DAS not committes:

- New and untested
- Higher latency than committees
- More edge cases
- **Committees are more forward-compatible with future addition of in-shard execution**
